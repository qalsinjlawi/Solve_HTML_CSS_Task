    <h3>Quartz is a widely occurring mineral composed of silicon dioxide (SiOâ‚‚) and is known for its hard, crystalline structure. It is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth, found in various types of rocks, including igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. Quartz comes in many colors and forms, with popular varieties like amethyst, citrine, and rose quartz often used in jewelry and decorative items. Due to its piezoelectric properties, quartz is also valuable in the electronics industry, where it helps regulate frequencies in clocks, radios, and other devices. With a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale, quartz is highly durable and resistant to scratching, making it suitable for many industrial and artistic applications.</h3>
